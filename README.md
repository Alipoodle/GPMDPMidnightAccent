# GPMDP Midnight Accent
**This theme is meant for the Dark Theme ONLY**

This is an CSS Theme for Google Play Music Desktop Player to add into the Custom Styles allowing you to have a coloured top bar and Border! This was inspired by the well know extension / theme for the Web version know as Play Midnight (and where I got the name for the project from).

A large amount of edits have been made for my personal taste but are all labeled as best as I can within the file for those who want to remove specific features that they might like, such as the Thumbs up and and down.

### Features

- Font : Included at the top is a Font! (This is disabled by default)
- Themed top and edges : This will make the sides and the top bar the same colour as your accent colour
- Removes
  - Shop button
  - Youtube Button
  - All Thumbs up / down stuff
  - Account info in the top right corner (This is more of a personal thing cause I'm never really gonna change accounts or anything from within the program)
- Textbox
  - Themed text highlighting in Edit
  - Search box fixes (Some which aren't on live version)
- Album Art
  - Enlarged Album art in Edit
  - Moves the Album Art buttons off the artwork
  - Dark default Album
- Icon
  - Pause, In current queue or within a library of songs.
  - Loading, In same places
- Fixes a few misc things as well (Including some which aren't on live, due to waiting for updates)
