# GPMDP Midnight Accent
**This theme is meant for the Dark Theme ONLY**

This is an CSS Theme for Google Play Music Desktop Player to add into the Custom Styles allowing you to have a coloured top bar and Border! This was inspired by the well know extension / theme for the Web version know as Play Midnight (and where I gave the name for it).

A large amount of edits have been made for my personal taste and the "free" version of Google Play Music. There's a few edits to the "All-Access" version for the few times I've been randomly given it!

### Features

- Font : Included at the top is a Font! (This is disabled by default)
- Themed top and edges : This will make the sides and the top bar the same colour as your accent colour
- Removes
  - Shop button
  - Youtube Button
  - All Thumbs up / down stuff
  - Account info in the top right corner (This is more of a personal thing cause I'm never really gonna change accounts or anything from within the program)
- Textbox
  - Themed text highlighting in Edit
  - Search box fixes (Some which aren't on live version)
- Album Art
  - Enlarged Album art in Edit
  - Moves the Album Art buttons off the artwork
  - Dark default Album
- Pause Icon : Adds the 2 bar when a specific song is paused.
- Fixes a few misc things as well

Everything in it is clearly shown with a comment nearby it!
